  101: "Support"
  102: "Is this safe?"
  103: "At Identity.com, we're committed to helping you control and protect your personal information. That means we won't share the data that you provide here on iD without your permission. We also use encrypted HTTPS connections to keep prying eyes away from your data."
  104: "Why do I need to provide my information?"
  105: "In order to find the public information that is already being shared about you, we need to know who you are! We use the information you provide to locate your public records, as well as to scan for places where your information may be improperly exposed."
  106: "How do you find information about me?"
  107: "First, we look at digitized public record sources across the US, such as court and county clerk websites. Because not all towns have digitized their records yet, you may not see records from locations that are still paper-only."
  108: "Second, we look at online black market forums and other locations where personal information is often illegally traded by hackers, to see if your email address or other online accounts have potentially been compromised."
